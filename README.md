## Musician Database

I wrote this application because I enjoy music. I'm always interested in new music and discovering new artists and their history.
My goal is to keep working on this website until it is ready to deploy.

I found it challenging to work with promises and modules. I did my best to separate code into modules but I need more practice.1

I chose Passport js because the documentation was good and there was a good example of how to set it up. I'm hoping I got it right, but I'd
need more time to test.

I went with Bootstrap because I like the simplicity of the color scheme. Bootstrap has a lot of great looking and functional components.

I added some CSS to align my Bootstrap components.
