https://a3-sadielombardi.glitch.me/

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- The goal of this application is to allow the user to create a task list that is stored on mondodb and can be accessed from their account.
- Challenges: Learning how to use mondodb, figuring out what express middlewares are, learning how to interact with the database through javascript, learning what a css framework is, implementing bootstrap
- Authentication Strategy:
- CSS Framework: Bootstrap
  - I added some styling for the background image, changed the length of some forms, and color of texts.
- Express Middleware Packages:the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does
- errorhandler: Create new middleware to handle errors and respond with content negotiation.
- bodyparser: The bodyParser object exposes various factories to create middlewares. All middlewares will populate the req.body property with the parsed body when the Content-Type request header matches the type option, or an empty object ({}) if there was no body to parse, the Content-Type was not matched, or an error occurred.
- session: Create a session middleware with the given options
- passport: Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js.
- serve-favicon: Node.js middleware for serving a favicon.
