The intention of this application was to be a scheduling application for activities in a week.
My biggest challenge during realizing the application was redirecting from a sign in page. I accessed the DB fine and inserted records, however attempting to connect the sign in page ate up far more time than expected, failing in the end.
Since redirection didnt work, I didn't successfully implement authorization, and I treated every login attempt as a new user.
I used tachyons for CSS.
I did not use 5 express middleware packages, just body parser and mongo
