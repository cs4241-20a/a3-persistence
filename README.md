## My Movie List

https://movielist.zph.io

- A multi-user movie list and ranking manager with scores.
- Uses local authentication with the username/password(encrypted) stored in Mongodb.
- Uses Bulma as the CSS framework.
- Middlewares used: body-parser, cookie-parser, express-session, csurf, express-validator.

### Technical Achievements
- **Security**: Uses csurf to prevent CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attack, express-validator for filtering user inputs to prevent XSS attack, and mongo-sanitize to sanitize NoSQL injections. User permissions to data entries are verifiedâ€”no unauthorized access or no user can modify others' data. Other security strategies such as setting the HttpOnly option for cookies, enabling TLS, and disabling X-Powered-By header are also implemented.
- **Modularity**: According to Node.js design concept, modular functions are separated into modules located in the routes directory, instead of all the stuff being in one file.
- **Deployment**: This project has been deployed at a Linode server with my own domain, and Nginx is used as the reverse proxy with the configuration file being provided. Uses PM2 as the process manager for Node. Hosting in a dedicated or virtual server gives the maximum privilege and flexibility for the application, whereas PaaS providers are more like a sandbox with the only advantage being easy to configure and deploy. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Public User Page**: Each user has a dedicated public page to show off their own movie list.
