Acheivements
---

Below are suggested technical and design achievements. You can use these to help boost your grade up to an A and customize the assignment to your personal interests, for a maximum twenty additional points and a maximum grade of a 100%. These are recommended acheivements, but feel free to create/implement your own... just make sure you thoroughly describe what you did in your README and why it was challenging. ALL ACHIEVEMENTS MUST BE DESCRIBED IN YOUR README IN ORDER TO GET CREDIT FOR THEM.

*Technical*
- (10 points) Implement OAuth authentication, perhaps with a library like [passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/). *You must either use Github authenticaion or provide a username/password to access a dummy account*. Course staff cannot be expected, for example, to have a personal Facebook, Google, or Twitter account to use when grading this assignment. Please contact the course staff if you have any questions about this.
- (5 points) Instead of Glitch, host your site on a different service like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) or [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com). Make sure to describe this a bit in your README. What was better about using the service you chose as compared to Glitch? What (if anything) was worse? 

*Design/UX*
- (10 points) Make your site accessible using the [resources and hints available from the W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/), Implement/follow twelve tips from their [tips for writing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/writing/), [tips for designing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/designing/), and [tips for development](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/developing/). *Note that all twelve must require active work on your part*. For example, even though your page will most likely not have a captcha, you don't get this as one of your twelve tips to follow because you're effectively getting it "for free" without having to actively change anything about your site. Contact the course staff if you have any questions about what qualifies and doesn't qualify in this regard. List each tip that you followed and describe what you did to follow it in your site.
- (5 points) Describe how your site uses the CRAP principles in the Non-Designer's Design Book readings. Which element received the most emphasis (contrast) on each page? How did you use proximity to organize the visual information on your page? What design elements (colors, fonts, layouts, etc.) did you use repeatedly throughout your site? How did you use alignment to organize information and/or increase contrast for particular elements. Write a paragraph of at least 125 words *for each of four principles* (four paragraphs, 500 words in total).

## Motocross Results Tracker

http://a3-nconill13.glitch.me

This application allows users to log into an account that tracks

- the goal of the application
- challenges you faced in realizing the application
- what authentication strategy you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable)
- what CSS framework you used and why
  - include any modifications to the CSS framework you made via custom CSS you authored
- the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used OAuth authentication via the GitHub strategy

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I followed the following tips from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative...
