## Nike Running Club Running Log

your glitch (or alternative server) link e.g. https://opinel98-a3-persistence.glitch.me

For this project all my responsibilities clashed and I couldn't manage my time well enough to deliver the webpage I would have hoped to 
produce but since there's a no late policy here's my partial work:

- the goal was to create a log for runners that are members the NRC
- Creating the connection with MongoDB was were I struggled the most beacuese I was closing the connection too soon
- unfortunately I didn't have enough time to implement the authentication system, express middlewares or the CSS template
