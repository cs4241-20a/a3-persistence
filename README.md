- The goal of this application is for users to be able to log into the website using Github, and have their credentials stored in a database so they can save their tasks. 
Users are able to add, edit, and delete to-do list items. 


- My biggest challenge in this application was getting the authentication to work properly. It took way longer than I had anticipated, and was very challenging.
I believe that the authentication was challenging because of the lack of documentation online regarding the methods and techniques of using Github Oauth. 


- I chose to use Github Oauth because I really wanted to challenge myself and maybe use this authentication in the future. This authentication was challenging, but I was also able to kill two birds
with one stone by implementing the Passport middleware with the Github authentication.


- I chose to use Bootstrap for this application because I had prior experience with it before. I also chose Bootstrap because they have fantastic documentation
and it's easy to implement into web applications.
  
  
- The five middleware packages I used for this web application are:

**Passport**
This middleware handles authentication for users simply.

**Body Parser**
This middleware parses the body of any received post requests 
and transforms it into json.

**Session**
This middleware establishes server-based sessions which is useful in implementing
authentication.

**Serve-Static**
This middleware serves static files within a given root directory.

**Morgan**
This middleware is a HTTP request logger, and gives developers access to see
HTTP requests.


## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used OAuth authentication via the GitHub strategy. 
In order for this to work due to a bug in Glitch, you must run/open the website in a new window.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- none
