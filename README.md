## Package Delivery Service

Glitch link http://a3-lindberg-simpson.glitch.me

This project is a page that would allow clients to send packages through a courier. To use this project, input the description of the package, the weight of the package in pounds and the deadline (in number of days) for the package to reach the destination. During this project I went through several preiods of the database not working the way I intended, and I had a lot of trouble figuring out the GitHub OAuth. There were a few things I could not get to work fully but the add and delete functions work with the MongoDB. For the front-end, I used the Cirrus CSS framework because I thought the design was very sleek and modern.
