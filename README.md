## Goal:
Coaches can sign into their account and add players (number, name, and experience level) to their roster.

## Challenges:
I struggled to get login working. I also struggled with connecting to the database.

## Authentication Strategy:
Both local and GitHub strategies were used.

## CSS Framework:
I used Bootstrap because it's one of the most popular frameworks.

## Express middleware packages:
passport: used to authenticate logins
body-parser: parses JSON objects
cookie-parser: parses cookies in each session
errorhandler: handles processing errors
cookie-session: simplifies certain load-balanced scenarios

# Technical Achievements

# Design/Evaluation Achievements
* **Design Achievement 1:** I followed the following tips from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative:
  1. Use headings to convey meaning and structure
  1. Provide sufficient contrast between foreground and background
  1. Ensure that form elements include clearly associated labels
  1. Use headings and spacing to group related content
  1. Associate a label with every form control
  1. Reflect the reading order in the code order
