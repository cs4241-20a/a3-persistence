The purpose of this web application is to allow a user to add, edit and delete data to a database.
Currently, you can only add entries to the database.
The data shown will only be the one that corresponds to the logged in user. 
This web app makes use of express js for the server, mongodb for the database and bootstrap for css design.
I used express-session for authentication since it had the most documentation.
I chose to use bootstrap since I had heard about it in the past.
