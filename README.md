Many things in life require persistence. Databases and running are 2 that come to mind.
In this project I have expanded the usefulness of my original a2 project to allow for signing in as a Github authenticated user with OAuth. It saves data to a MongoDB server and has 2 way communication on add/update/delete
In addition, this project has an effective implementation of a logout button for disposing of session data

I chose OAuth because I wanted the challenge of using what is considered a more convenient and in some ways more secure login method.

I used pure.css to create a sleek and minimalist style with a pop of color and good layout

Express middleware used in this project: cookie-parser, body-parser, compression, response-time and passport. There may be others not mentioned but these 5 are the primary ones for the grading criteria

Some challenges I faced during this project were my authentication flows. I am very obviously submitting a couple hours past the due date because of the difficulties faced in getting my code to actually authenticate.
I still have no idea why it was not working, but regardless I revised my code repeatedly until it finally began to work.

Some things I wish I improved on for this project would be getting most of the preliminary work out of the way to focus more on the achievements section. I left too much work with not a lot of time and it has cost me sleep (_and some sanity_) but hopefully not my grade.
A lesson well learned and one I will remember for the next assignment and the final project.

I also wish I could've explored accessibility more, as I was putting more effort into core features. Hopefully that can be my focus on my next assignment.

## Technical Achievements

- **OAuth Authentication**: Via Github strategy you can login to the website using OAuth.
