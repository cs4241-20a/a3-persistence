Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application (TODO)
- challenges you faced in realizing the application (TODO)
- what authentication strategy you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable) (GitHub OAuth with Passport)
- what CSS framework you used and why (Bootstrap, most well-known, good documentation, I'm familiar with it, I think it looks good)
  - include any modifications to the CSS framework you made via custom CSS you authored (TODO)
- the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does
  (using: express.static [serves static assets], express.json [parses raw json of request bodies], morgan [access logging], compression [compresses request data using gzip], helmet [adds security to API by setting various HTTP headers])

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used OAuth authentication via the GitHub strategy
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I deployed my application to Heroku
