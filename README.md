## Your Web Application Title

your glitch (or alternative server) link e.g. https://a3-wying8349.glitch.me/

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- A score board for students to input their scores. They can also query the scores. 
- I faced many challenges, especially when it comes to submitting data to the database.
- what authentication strategy you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable)
- I used materialize by Material Design because I feel it is well designed.
- the five Express middleware packages I used:
  - body-parser: Parse HTTP request body.
  - passport: Authentication using “strategies” (OAuth)
  - timeout: Set a timeout period for HTTP request processing.
  - form-body: I want to read the body of a HTML <form> submission.
  - multer: Handle multi-part form data.
  
## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Implement OAuth authentication with [passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/). 
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Instead of Glitch, I hosted my site on a different service called [Heroku](https://arcane-beach-00606.herokuapp.com/). An advantage of heroku is that it have a database so I don't need to find another like what I did with glitch. It's disadvantage is that its complicated and does not have a good tutorial for beginners. 


### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I followed the following tips from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative:
Associate a label with every form control: used for and id attributes. 
Help users avoid and correct mistakes: tell them that they must fill some attributes and some of them must be a number
