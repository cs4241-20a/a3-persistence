## Watchlist

 http://a3-chaarke.glitch.me

- **The Goal:** a place for users to record movies they want to see. 
- **The Challenges:** fiddling with passport.js. I spent close to 4 hours on a stack overflow rabbit hole. 
- **The Authentication:** Passport.js for Github OAuth! I used it for the bonus points.
- **The Framework:** Bootstrap. It's a classic, I've worked with it before and enjoy using their layout grid more than the diy approach with css grid.
- **The Middleware:** Passport. Bodyparser. Express Session. Favicon. Response Time.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used OAuth authentication via the GitHub strategy

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I followed the following tips from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative:
1. Informative page title: my page it title Watchlist - rank films that you want to see, explaining the purpose of the site. 

2. Headings: I utilize headings to split the site into three sections: the title heading, the form, and the result list. I do not skip heading levels. 

3. Clear instructions: I succinctly explain how to add movies to your list, or view your list without adding a movie. 

4. Concise content: my page is pretty bare bones while still conveying the necessary instructions for use. 

5. Contrast: I kept default white-on-black color schemes for all page elements.

6. Form element labels: all of my form elements are labelled.

7. Viewport flexibility: I chose to use bootstrap as my css framework to improve viewport accessibility. 

8. Language: Language is defined as English.

9. Read order: code is written in the order: heading, form, result to reflect the typical Z-pattern English readers view media.

10. Color to convey info: the only color present is the button, which is also clearly labelled as sumbit to highlight its importance.

11. Identifying interactive elements: form elements and submit button are clearly explained and labelled, as well as being outlined/shaded to draw attention. 

12. Spacing to group content: by using bootstrap's grid, I placed the page heading above all other content, and spaced the results card from the form to make it a clearly distinct element.
