## to do list 

https://to-do-list-1234556.herokuapp.com/ and https://a3-alvaradoblancouribe.glitch.me/ 

the goal of this application is to create a to-do list for students  

I used Bootstrap as my CSS template for the login page due to it's popularity and wide range of use. 

I used Passport.js for authorization because it's what was recommended and hosted the website on Heroku. 

I used these express middleware packages:
- body-parses to read the body data 
- passport for authorization 
- express-session - attempted to use it to get user data before everything started falling  apart
- cors - enables cross-origin resource sharing, used for apis 

Challenges I faced:
- Incorporating authentication into the platform 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Uploading it to Heroku
